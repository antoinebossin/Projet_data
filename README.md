# 🩺 Diabetes and Pregnancy Risk Prediction

This project focuses on analyzing and modeling a dataset concerning **pregnant women with diabetes**.  
Diabetes is a significant risk factor affecting the healthy progression of pregnancy, and this study aims to identify and classify levels of obstetric risk based on physiological indicators.

## 📊 Dataset Description

For each woman in the dataset, the following **7 variables** are provided:

| Variable | Description |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Age** | Age in years |
| **Systolic blood pressure** | Systolic blood pressure in mmHg |
| **Diastolic blood pressure** | Diastolic blood pressure in mmHg |
| **Blood sugar** | Postprandial blood sugar in mmol/L |
| **Temperature** | Body temperature in °C |
| **Resting heart rate** | Resting heart rate (beats per minute) |
| **Risk** | Degree of obstetric risk *(0: low, 1: medium, 2: high)* |

## 🧩 Project Objectives

The project is divided into **three main parts**:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Study the distribution and correlation of variables  
   - Detect potential outliers or anomalies  
   - Visualize patterns and relationships in the data  

2. **Binary Classification**  
   - Build a model to distinguish between **at-risk** and **not-at-risk** pregnancies  
   - Evaluate performance using standard metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)

3. **Multi-Class Classification**  
   - Develop a classifier to predict the **risk level** among the three categories:  
     **low**, **medium**, and **high**  
   - Compare model performances and interpret key predictive features

## 🧠 Tools and Methods

- **Python**, with libraries such as:
  - `pandas`, `numpy` – data manipulation  
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn` – data visualization  
  - `scikit-learn` – model building and evaluation

## 🚀 Goals

- Understand how different health indicators relate to pregnancy risks  
- Build robust predictive models to assist medical decision-making  
- Apply data science methods to a meaningful real-world health problem
